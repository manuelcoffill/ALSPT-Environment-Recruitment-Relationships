Data processing steps:
Step 1 - collect areas with X salinity or greater based on hourly model output.
Step 2 - compute spatial average of water temperature within areas from Step 1.
Step 3 - compute temporal average of areas from Step 1 and water temp from Step 2.
Step 4 - compute temporal max of areas from Step 1 and water temp from Step 2.
